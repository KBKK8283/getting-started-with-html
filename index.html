<b>Notes from Lesson 0</b><br><br>
<em>Introduction</em><br>
<p>- The WWW is a collection of HTML documents.<br>
- HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language."<br>
- Hyperlinks serve as a glue which binds HTML documents with one another.<br>
- Below is a basic illustration of the WWW:</p>
<p>User/PC/Browser (User makes a <b>request</b> via the internet to servers.)<br>
|<br>
| http (Requests via the internet are made via a protocol called http.)<br>
|<br>
The Internet<br>
|<br>
| http<br>
|<br>
Servers  (Servers, computers optimized for holding files and responding to<br>
http requests made by a browser, respond to a request by sending files that a<br>
users browser will display.)</p>
<em>HTML</em>
<p>- HTML documents are the heart of the web.<br>
- HTML is <b>comprised of several components:</b><br>
**text content (what you see)<br>
**markup (what is looks like)<br>
**references to other documents (e.g. images & videos)<br>
**links to other pages
</p>
<em>HTML Markup</em>
<p>- HTML Markup is the use of waht are termed <b>elements</b>.<br>
- Elements are comprised of several compents:<br>
**Opening tag<br>
**Contents<br>
**Closing tag<br>
- Below is a basic illustration of how an element works:<br>
**An opening tag is typed first. The opening tag lets the HTML code know<br> 
where you want the contents to begin being affected by the tag.<br>
**Next the contents are typed<br>
**A closing tag is then typed at the point where you want the contents to<br>
end being affected by the tag.<br>
-There are multiple tags that can be used to affect the contents in
in a desired way<br>
- Some examples include: the B tag (Bolds contents), the EM tag (italiscizes<br>
contents), and the BR tag (causes the contents typed after the BR tag to appear on<br>
the line below the contents typed before the BR tag).
- Elements are also used to display images and links to other web pages.<br>
  - Elements are classified as <b>in-line</b> or <b>block</b>:<br>
**Block elements create an invisible block around the contents that can<br>
be manipulated<br>
**In-line elements just translate text
</p>
<em>Structure of an HTML Document</em>
<p>- Two main parts of an HTML document:<br>
  **Head - contains the title of the document as well as metadata, javascript, and CSS <br>
  **Body - contains the majority of the content and elements affecting the content to<br>
  display images, links, bold letters, etc...
  - There is also an HTML element that tags the beginning and end of the whole document.
